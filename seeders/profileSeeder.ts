  bio_long: `Since my childhood, I've been a tech geek with an insatiable curiosity for all things, especially digital. It was clear to me from an early age that my future lay in the world of technology; I just hadn't quite figured out the specific path I wanted to take.

### The Beginning
My proper journey into the tech world began with me spending countless hours tinkering with custom ROMs, bricking and unbricking my devices. This hands-on experience not only further fueled my passion for technology but also sparked my desire to dive deeper into the realm of software development.

### The Decision
In 2019, I made the decision to pursue a career in software engineering. Following my university education, I embarked on a transformative journey by enrolling in the **ALX Software Engineering** program.

### My Focus
Since then, I've been dedicated to:
* üöÄ Expanding my knowledge and skills
* üîç Constantly pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve in the world of software
* üíª Building things while thoroughly enjoying the process, because well; it's part of my Ikigai

### Today
I proudly stand as a Software Engineer with:
* üî• A deep-rooted passion for technology
* üìö A commitment to lifelong learning
* üåü A desire to make a meaningful impact through my work
